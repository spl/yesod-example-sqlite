# Yesod Example (SQLite)

This is a small example app generated by `yesod init` (`yesod-bin-1.4.3.10`)
with the `s` option (for SQLite).

This repository is only for reference. I'm just keeping the code around so I
don't have to create it again.

## Install dependencies

```
$ cabal sandbox init
$ cabal --require-sandbox install -j --only-dependencies --max-backjumps=-1 --reorder-goals
